Installing GWpy
===============

To install GWpy, please see :all:`install`.

If you are working on the LIGO Data Grid sites at CIT, LHO, or LLO, you can use the `GWpySoft <https://wiki.ligo.org/DetChar/GWpySoft>`_ virtualenv, which provides the latest release of GWpy (or newer) and any other dependencies that go beyond what is available as standard on that system.

To activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ . /home/detchar/opt/gwpysoft-2.7/bin/activate

When you are finished working in this environment, you can run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ deactivate

to return to your original environment.
